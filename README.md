# MeowGAN: Feline Image Synthesis with Deep Learning

Welcome to MeowGAN, a project dedicated to the art and science of generating cat images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our goal is to push the boundaries of AI-driven creativity, producing an array of unique and captivating feline images that showcase the power of deep learning.

## Project Overview

MeowGAN uses a dataset of thousands of cat images to train a GAN, learning to mimic the complex patterns that characterize our furry friends. This repository contains all the code and documentation necessary to train your own MeowGAN model, experiment with different architectures, and generate your own cat images.

## Features

- Detailed implementation of DCGAN architecture for image generation.
- Preprocessing scripts for image dataset preparation.
- Training scripts with checkpointing and logging.
- Utility for generating images from trained models.
- Examples of generated cat images.
